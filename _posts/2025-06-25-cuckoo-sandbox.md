# Cuckoo Sandbox in 2025: Legacy Tool or Hidden Gem?

`Cuckoo Sandbox`. You’ve probably heard the name, maybe in a SANS training, maybe in an old GitHub repo, or buried in some SOC analyst’s toolset from a decade ago. For a while, it was *the* open-source solution for dynamic malware analysis. But time passed, the threat landscape evolved, and Cuckoo slowly slipped into obscurity, labeled by many as outdated, slow, and too painful to maintain. So why revisit it now? Why bring Cuckoo out of the rubble in 2025? Well... because sometimes, old tools still have sharp teeth.
