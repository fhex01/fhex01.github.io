# Targeted Timeroasting: Weaponizing Computers with Controlled UAC Flags

Do you know **NTP**, or its Microsoft Windows variant, **MS-SNTP**? Well, I racked my brain trying to figure out what it was, and I found it really interesting. In this article, we will focus exclusively on the **MS-SNTP** protocol. We will explore how this protocol could potentially be exploited to steal authentication or identification credentials. 

First, we will examine how the **MS-SNTP** protocol works and how it is used within **Active Directory** infrastructures. We will also highlight its importance in such environments. Next, we will explore how the **MS-SNTP** protocol can be abused by proposing a variation of an existing attack. We will develop a proof-of-concept exploit (`PoC`) and then suggest possible **remediations** to protect against this attack.
