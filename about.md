# About

I'm a hacker and independent security researcher with a strong focus on Microsoft technologies and ecosystems. My interests span across Windows internals, Active Directory security, Azure infrastructure, offensive tooling, and detection evasion techniques.

Over the years, I’ve worked on various projects involving vulnerability research, red teaming, and advanced persistence mechanisms. I’m passionate about deeply understanding how systems work, and how they can be broken, to ultimately help improve their security.

This blog is a space where I document my findings, share my thoughts, and explore complex technical topics. All posts are original, and aim to provide both practical value and theoretical insights for security professionals, researchers, and curious minds alike.

If you're interested in collaboration, research discussions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.
